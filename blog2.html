                    on to more complex writing tasks.

                    3. Face feedback and critique. Do not react negatively on getting a non-positive feedback, because those are what are gonna help you think widely and imporive your ideas. Feedback from peers or professors can help you identify areas
                    of improvement and refine your writing skills. Consider joining a writing group or workshop, or seek
                    feedback from a tutor or professor.
